# About the Datapack Library 

- The "datapack-library" folder is a custom folder designed to contain data packs that should be compatible with its containing instance. 
- To use a data pack in datapack-library, copy it (don't 'move' it) into the "datapacks" folder of the desired world folder, i.e.: 

```
  \.minecraft\saves\<WORLD_NAME>\datapacks\
```
- Whereas resourcepacks and other packs are generally associated with *instances*, datapacks are associated with inividual *worlds*.
