# About Painting Pack Maker

- Painting Pack Maker (PPM) is an Java-based app that allows a user to copy images from their device into a format that can be used in Minecraft as in-game paintings.
- In order to use these custom paintings, Minecraft must also be running the Paintings++ mod. 
- After adding the desired images, the app can generate a resourcepack which can then be installed in the game's/instance's resourcepack folder, e.g., `\.minecraft\resourcepacks`.
- PPM can run on most computers that have Java 17 installed. This is the same version that is required to run Minecraft 1.18 and later versions, so if a user is able to run one of these versions of Minecraft their machine, they should be also able to run Painting Pack Maker.
- For detailed instructions, see the [developer's GitHub repository](https://github.com/AbsolemJackdaw/PaintingPackMaker).
